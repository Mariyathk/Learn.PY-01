# Learn.PY
Hi I made this project on the basis of the programme LEARN.PY by TinkerHub. 

This programme is to learn python from scratch by the python challenge, which starts from June 7 onwards.  This programme helps to learn by ourselves by accepting challenges.

<cr>While finishing the project ,
<cr>I will get hands to experience on:
  <li>Python base
  <li>Numpy
  <li>pandas
<br>Everything will be submitted through github;
